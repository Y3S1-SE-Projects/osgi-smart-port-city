## Use Case Scenario
We will be building an OSGi application for the ongoing construction of the Port City in Sri Lanka. Our object is to make a “Smart Port City” and produce services to the customers going in and out of the Port City, where they would be able to subscribe or consume those services in their own convenience. 

However, you may ask why we have chosen the OSGi framework as our technology to develop this application? We know that among the construction of the Port City there would be many different services added from time to time such as various restaurants, different types of hotels etc. Therefore, from a developer’s point of view implementing each of these services may be a hustle and would take a long time to develop. The application would be large which can be difficult to maintain, difficult to maintain security and implement new services. New developers may find it difficult to comprehend the code and hence would increase development time. However, the OSGi framework solves this problem.

The OSGi framework provides mainly reliable configuration, strong encapsulation and high modularity. Modularity enables the program to separate the functionality of a large program into independent, interchangeable modules, in such a way that each module would contain everything it needs to execute one single functionality. Therefore, we can say that each module is fully encapsulated thus reducing security vulnerabilities. As you can see, due to these advantages of the OSGi framework for our use case this technology would be the perfect choice.
